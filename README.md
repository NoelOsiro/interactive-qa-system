Below is the corrected and properly formatted Markdown for your guide to submitting the Interactive Q&A System Backend. I’ve fixed indentation, ensured consistent formatting, and organized the content for clarity while maintaining all the details you provided. The Markdown is ready to be used in your README.md or submission documentation.

# Interactive Q&A System Backend

A FastAPI backend for an interactive Q&A system with Gemini LLM integration.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd backend
Create a virtual environment:
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables:
Copy .env.example to .env:
bash
cp .env.example .env
Add your Gemini API key to .env:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
Run the server:
bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
Access the API:
Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
Test endpoint: POST /api/ask with body {"query": "Your question"}
Prompt Engineering
The LLM prompt is designed to ensure clear, concise, and formatted responses:
You are a helpful AI assistant specializing in programming and technical questions. 
Provide a clear, concise, and accurate answer to the following question. 
Use markdown formatting for code snippets, lists, and headings if appropriate.

Question: {query}

Answer:
This prompt instructs the LLM to:
Focus on programming/technical topics.
Use markdown for readability (e.g., code blocks, lists).
Keep answers concise and accurate.
Notes
Gemini API Key: Ensure your API key is valid and within free-tier limits. If you hit rate limits, you may need to add retry logic in llm_service.py.
Prompt Engineering: The prompt is tailored for technical Q&A, matching the frontend’s focus (e.g., programming questions). You can adjust it for other use cases.
Mock Responses: If you’re unable to use the Gemini API, you can temporarily modify llm_service.py for mock responses:
python
async def get_llm_response(query: str) -> str:
    return f"Mock response to: {query}"
Frontend Integration: Your chat.js page is already set up to call http://localhost:8000/api/ask. Ensure the frontend handles the response and timestamp fields correctly.
Error Handling: The backend validates input and handles API errors, meeting the assessment’s requirements.
Troubleshooting
API Key Issues
If you get a 500 error about the API key, double-check .env and ensure the key is valid.
Rate Limits
If Gemini returns a 429 error, add a delay or retry mechanism:
python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_fixed

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_fixed(2))
async def get_llm_response(query: str) -> str:
    # Existing code
Install tenacity:
bash
pip install tenacity
echo "tenacity" >> requirements.txt
CORS Issues
If the frontend can’t reach the backend, add CORS middleware to main.py:
python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app = FastAPI(
    title="Interactive Q&A System API",
    description="API for an interactive Q&A system with Gemini LLM integration",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# Add CORS middleware
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],  # Frontend URL
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

### Changes Made
- **Fixed Indentation**: Ensured consistent Markdown indentation (e.g., 2 spaces for lists, 4 spaces for code blocks).
- **Corrected Code Blocks**: Properly formatted Bash and Python code with triple backticks (```).
- **Organized Sections**: Grouped related content (e.g., all troubleshooting under a dedicated header).
- **Improved Clarity**: Added proper headings and removed redundant text (e.g., incomplete sentences).
- **Maintained Content**: Kept all your instructions, including setup steps, prompt engineering, notes, and troubleshooting.

### Submission Guide
To submit your project as per the assessment requirements:

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Ensure your repository contains:
     - **Backend Code**: `main.py`, `routes/ask.py`, `services/llm_service.py`, `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`.
     - **Documentation**: `README.md` with the above Markdown.
     - **Prompt Details**: Included in `README.md` under “Prompt Engineering.”
   - Commit and push:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Complete backend for Interactive Q&A System with Gemini"
     git push origin main
     ```

2. **Verify Repository**:
   - Check that your GitHub repository is public (or accessible to the reviewers).
   - Confirm all files are present and `.env` is excluded (via `.gitignore`).

3. **Optional Deployment** (Bonus):
   - Deploy the backend to a platform like Render or Heroku.
   - Update `README.md` with the deployed URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.onrender.com/docs`).
   - Example for Render:
     - Create a new Web Service on Render.
     - Set the runtime to Python.
     - Add the build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
     - Set the start command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`.
     - Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` as an environment variable in Render’s dashboard.

4. **Submit the Link**:
   - Provide the GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/interactive-qa-system`) in your assessment submission.
   - If deployed, include the deployed URL.

### Notes
- **Gemini Integration**: The backend is fully configured for Gemini, as per your preference. If you need help testing the API or frontend integration, let me know.
- **Frontend**: Ensure your `chat.js` page handles the `response` and `timestamp` fields from the `/api/ask` endpoint.
- **Time Allocation**: The assessment allows 3 days, so prioritize testing the full flow (frontend + backend) before submission.
